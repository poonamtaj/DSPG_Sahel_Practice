# Identifying the Vulnerable to Poverty from Natural Disasters
## The Case of Typhoons in the Philippines

Main Question: short overview of the research question and objective of the paper
	The main objective of the paper is to take a look at how typhoons in the Philippines are affecting the people living there and the households overall. It takes a look at wind speed and household FIES(food insecurity experience scale) and compares how the different levels of wind speed from typhoons impact consumption of the households. The objective is to take this information and create regression models that can help predict future natural disasters and see which households would be considered vulnerable to poverty. The ultimate goal is to use these models to support households before a natural disaster strikes.

Methods and Data: what is the sample size, which region/study area, method employed
The main data comes from using bagray (the smallest administrative division in the Philippines) level data from the households in the Philippines and using the FIES for the years 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2015. THe FIES is collected twice a year in July and January. Typhoon season occurs during the second half of the calendar year so we get data from the FIES before the Typhoon season and after. Lastly this is using estimated local wind speeds or shock measures when/where a tropical typhoon passes through. 

Results: what are the main findings
The overall findings show that 6 months before the typhoon hit, there was statistically significant data concluding that they consumed more products, but specifically more food and protein. Fruits, vegetables, cereals, education, medical services and nonfood items seemed to be unaffected by typhoons or wind speed.

Significance: what is the significance of the study undertaken
This study made significant progress on estimating the impacts of typhoons on household consumptions and being able to identify household potential vulnerability to poverty from typhoons. The regression model that was created can help identify households vulnerable to poverty. This can help provide aid to those that need it before typhoon season most effectively.
