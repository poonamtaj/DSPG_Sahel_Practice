(Use this file to create one rmd for our literature summary. Heading/subheadings include- your name, title of the paper, summary, reference in APA style. Feel free to work on YAML headings as part of practice. 
Further, if you like to go ahead and put map of Niger that you practiced in GEE could be a addition to showcase what you have learned so far.)
